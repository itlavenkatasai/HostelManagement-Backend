Hostel Management Project Backend :  
This project main goal is to manage the hostel rooms and room members esaisly with out pen and paper.

-----------steps for create API's in nodejs------------
0) create a empty folder with your project name and create git repositery and clone repo into this folder.

npm installation steps: these commands are fundamental setting and managing nodejs project,allowing you to handle project meta data and dependicies effectively.

1) npm init
2) npm install
-->The npm init command is used to create a new package.json file for yours nodejs project.the package.json file holds a various meta data relevant to the project and is crucial for managing dependencies and script. 
-->The npm install command is used to install dependencies listed in the package.json file.

package.json --> package.json is a crucial part of the any nodejs project it contains the meta data,dependencies,configuration about project.
    -metaData: name,version,description,main:the entry point for the project (usually a javascript file like index.js) 
    -dependencies: 
            dependencies:Lists the packages required for the project run in production.
            devDependencies:Lists the packages needed for development(ex:testing,frameworks,build tools)
    -scripts:define various commands that can be run using 'npm run <script name>' scripts include : start,test,build
    -repositeryInformation
package-lock.json --> <The package-lock.json file is automatically generated by npm and is intended to provide a detailed description of the exact dependency tree that was installed. It ensures that the project can be reinstalled in a consistent state.>    
-- what is node_modules
    <the node_modules directory is an essential part of any nodejs project,serving as the storage for all project dependencies. it is automatically managed by package managers like npm and yarn,allowing you to eaisly add,remove,update,delete dependencies without manual intervantion.
    -- It serves as the location where all the dependencies (libraries and packages) required by your project are installed
    --When you require or import a package in your code, Node.js looks for the package in the node_modules directory. It uses a module resolution algorithm to locate the correct package.>

----> HOW TO CONNECT NODEJS WITH MONGO DATABASES <--------  

    -->first install mongoose (npm install mongoose).
    -->create (db folder ) and in the folder create one file.
    -->import mongoose from 'mongoose'
    -->error handling using try and catch.one function is available connect
    ex: mongoose.connect('local mongo url with collection name');
    any error occur it will catch error handling.
    ex: import mongooose from 'mongoose';
        const dbConnectedToMongo = ()=>{
            try{
                mongoose.connect("url");
                console.log("node is connected to mongo")
            }catch(error){
                console.log(error);
                console.log("node is not connected to mongo")
            }
        } 
-->how to create database model for hostel management  
    **registration for hostel owners model
    register hostel owners using name,phoneNumber,password.use this consteaints create database model.
    ex:import mongoose from 'mongoose'
       const hostelOwnersSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
        name : {type:String,required:true},
        phoneNumber : {type:Number,required:true},
        password : {type : String,required:true}
       })      
    export const hostelOwner = mongoose.model('hostelOwners',hostelOwnerSchema);
    ** <while creating registration data please secure the password using "bcrypt">
    -->How to bcrypt the password...
    > install bcrypt using command npm install bcrypt.
    > import bcrypt from 'bcrypt'
    > const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password,10); this mean plaintext password is being hashed using bcrypt package with a salt rounds value of 10.

    ** how to create token while login hostel Owner
    > using jsonwebtoken 
    - uses of jwt 
     * Authentication : stateless Authentication :  JWTs are often used to implement stateless authentication. Once a user is authenticated, a JWT token is generated and sent to the client. The client then includes this token in the Authorization header of subsequent requests. The server can then verify the token to authenticate the user without needing to maintain session state.
     * Single Sign-On (SSO): JWT tokens are used in SSO solutions to provide seamless access to multiple applications without requiring the user to log in separately to each one.
    * Authorization : After successful authentication, a JWT can be used to authorize access to different parts of an application. The token can contain claims about the user's roles or permissions, which the server can check to decide if the user has access to a particular resource.
    ** token creation using jwt
    const token = jwt.sign(payload,token_secret,token_expiry);
